# To-Do List on Rails

Hello, my name is Artur Chukhrai and I am new to Ruby.

This is my first Ruby on Rails project!

It's a simple To-Do List where you can create your account and add tasks there. Tasks can be created and viewed in the Markdown format. This is what I consider a small feature of this project.
